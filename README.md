# Udacity-Ajax-API-Project ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code%20Statue-CLose-red.svg)
This repository is the code that I created during the Udacity Ajax and API Project.

The project includes the ability to import photos from Unsplash using the API and Ajax, and the ability to import articles using the New York Times API. Ajax and Fetch were used to step by step, and API key was included in the header and sent to the server to learn how to get the right data and utilize it for JSON data.
